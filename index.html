                What we now know as Tiktok was once called Musical.ly. Similar to the platform millions use daily, Musical.ly began trending worldwide for its viral dances and bizzare trends. After gaining fast popularity the app exploded during the 2020 pandemic which left many confined to their homes and left to wonder the enigma behind TikTok. Used as a social vector for families and friends to share their creative experiences, TikTok has become a leading app for new generation to come.

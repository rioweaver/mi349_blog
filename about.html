             Living in a digital society it is important to recognize the dangers and benefits of social media, and how they affect our overall health. Tiktok has an algorithm that pulls users into a world of endless scrolling, with the occasional reminder to take a break from Tiktok. The enormous amount of content available to entertain its viewers makes it difficult for users to pull away. Listening to me friends and family tell me about their persistant use of TikTok led me to wonder how safe and addictive TikTok really is.
